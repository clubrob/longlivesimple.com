            <p class="has-text-left">
              Needing a business logo refresh recently, I was recommended to Carley by my web developer,
              who had seen her work on another project.
            </p>
            <p
              class="has-text-left"
            >Carley and her skill set was exactly what I needed. Her work was prompt, offered a variety of choices, and expertly updated a 20-year-old image to modern standards very successfully. In addition to her graphics she has also offered marketing advice and suggestions that are valuable and appreciated.</p>
            <p class="has-text-left">It's been great working with Carley and Long Live Simple.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="has-text-left">What I love most about Carley is her cheerful friendliness.</p>
            <p
              class="has-text-left"
            >She's very upbeat and kind, which put me at ease in a process I'd never been on this side of before. I loved her structured business processes, which not only made our work together clearer for me but made it obvious to me that she's put careful thought into her work with her clients. It inspired me to amp up my own game as a fellow freelancer! There were charming personal touches and pleasant, generous surprises along the way that made the project fun. She never made me feel like I was inconveniencing or annoying her with my questions or rounds of revisions, and I didn't feel rushed through our project. I worried that a designer would push me in a direction that wouldn't be a good fit for me and my brand, but while I could trust Carley to always let me know her expert perspective as an experienced designer, she didn't force a certain vision on our work together. Her hand-lettering is technically skilled and beautiful, and it was clear to me she knew what she was doing as a designer.</p>
            <p
              class="has-text-left"
            >I'm very pleased with my finished branding and am happy to recommend Carley and her work.</p>
